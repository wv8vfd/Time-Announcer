# Time-Announcer
### A simple program to make time announcements on a DVM Project system via DVM Bridge 

If you are wanting to use this, you should probably have the knowledge to compile and use it. Once compiled, copy the config.yml to your build directory, edit for your system, and run. Make sure you have DVM Bridge running. 

This was made using AI for my system only. I make no promises it will work for you. No support is provided for it. I just wanted to share it in case anyone else wants to use it, or make it better.
